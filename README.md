# Learning Agent Framework

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a learning agent framework using Autogen for generating teaching materials and test questions. The framework consists of three agents: Researcher, Writer, and Examiner, each responsible for specific tasks in the learning process.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Autogen
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Lawal0abdulazeez/learning-agent-framework.git>
    cd learning-agent-framework
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Agents

### Researcher Agent

The Researcher Agent (`researcher_agent.py`) generates ideas for teaching a subject.

- **How to Run:**

    ```bash
    python researcher_agent.py
    ```

    - Replace `'your_subject'` with the actual subject you want to teach.

### Writer Agent

The Writer Agent (`writer_agent.py`) generates a coherent explanation based on the ideas generated by the Researcher.

- **How to Run:**

    ```bash
    python writer_agent.py
    ```

    - Ensure you have the output file from the Researcher Agent (`researcher_output.txt`).

### Examiner Agent

The Examiner Agent (`examiner_agent.py`) generates test questions based on the explanation created by the Writer.

- **How to Run:**

    ```bash
    python examiner_agent.py
    ```

    - Ensure you have the output file from the Writer Agent (`writer_output.txt`).

### Main Script

The main script (`main.py`) orchestrates the entire workflow, running each agent sequentially.

- **How to Run:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    - Ensure you have the required outputs from the Researcher and Writer Agents.
